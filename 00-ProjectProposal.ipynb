    "Light pollution, the common phrase for regions with excessive artificial lighting at night time, has been a long growing concern in regards to the environment, as well as the psychological well being of the public. Studies have shown that being exposed to artificial light at night can disrupt your circadian rhythm, causing mood swings or poor sleep. Satellite imagery tools such as the [Light Pollution Map](https://lightpollutionmap.app/?lat=45.706179&lng=-86.440430&zoom=5&opacity=50&auroraOpacity=90) and observational datasets like Globe at Night let us see the variances in light pollution by area, and we can see a common trend where the more populated the region is, the more light pollution is present. \n",
    "\n",
    "These extensive tooling have been used for environmental research, and are reliable in comparing light pollution levels across the U.S. However, most existing projects or studies try to link these stats to mental health outcomes in humans on a large scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "The prevalence of depression in humans varies widely by region. Data from the [Center of Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm) (CDC) highlights that a majority of adults in the U.S. have reported experiencing depression in one form or another, with notable differences between states. Additional state level stats from the [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/mental-health-statistics-by-state) and even [government owned websites](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/adult-depression-lghc-indicator-627e3) further confirm the differences in severity of depression depending on the region. We have extensive datasets to independently track mental health trends and variances in light pollution, but very few projects try to combine mental health indicators and environmental exposure data. As such, we want to build our project on these existing datasets, and study the effects of state level light pollution levels with depression prevalence data to find out whether regions with higher light pollution also report higher cases of depression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent peer-reviewed research has also supported this connection. A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis examining over half a million participants found that both indoor and outdoor artificial light at night were associated with increased risks of depression, suggesting that consistent nighttime brightness can negatively affect mental well-being (Chen et al., 2024). \n"

    "States with higher levels of light pollution will have more cases of diagnosed depression compared to states with lower light pollution levels. This hypothesis is based on existing research discussed in the background section showing that artificial light at night is associated with disruptions in normal sleep patterns and overall well-being. Since the project compares state-level light-pollution intensity data with reported depression statistics it’s reasonable to expect that areas with consistently higher nighttime brightness may also show higher rates of diagnosed depression. The relationship isn’t assumed to be purely causal but rather an observable association between environmental light exposure and mental-health indicators across regions."

The ideal data set would also have light pollution levels for the states to use in assessing the connection between depression and light pollution, including a scaler to account for population density to mitigate the issue of data showcasing the obvious fact that data is larger in high populated states. Optimally this data should be well formatted in a data table preferable in json or csv format.\n",

    "Even though this study is only looking at correlations between nighttime light exposure and mental-health data I think there is a risk of misunderstanding the results as direct cause-and-effect. For example the city planners might reduce lighting too aggressively without thinking about safety, transportation visibility, or nighttime business activity. There is also a chance that states or regions with higher reported depression or anxiety rates could become stigmatized or be unfairly judged. Mental health is influenced by many different social and economic factors and so focusing only on light pollution is oversimplifying a much bigger issue. To avoid this, the study will explain clearly its limitations and emphasize that the findings show associations and not definite causes.\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",

    "\n",
    "> We are diving into the topic of mental health, so it is important to have their consent to use datasets in regards to their mental health symptoms, such as whether they have depression. We will ensure that the datasets we use note that the participants were consenting. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    " > While we are not personally collecting the data, we are gathering it amongst various public datasets. We will try to find datasets that have a diverse variety of participants to minimize bias. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " > We will not be using any personally identifiable information such as name, but will instead be using datasets that have been anonymized \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    " > As we look at the relationship between light pollution and mental health, we may find a relationship that actually represents race or culture. We will try to reduce bias for these by taking into consideration the distribution of race and the light pollution distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    " > If we have any private or personal information, data security is very important. However, we are using publicly available datasets, without people’s personal information.\n",

    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    " > Any person should have the right to remove their personal information. We are using a public dataset, so we will likely not have their personal information in the first place. \n",

    "\n",
    "- [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    " > We will consider the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics possibility to include trade-offs like bias, overfitting, and unequal subgroup performance so we plan to monitor other metrics like fairness and error distributions to verify improvements reflected real, responsible model performance.\n",

    "### E. Deployment\n",
    "- [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    " > Yes, we can implement a response process where potential harms are reviewed. Cases would be analyzed by the team and insights are used to update data, metrics, model, etc. to reduce risk of future harm.\n",

    "\n",
    " > Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "The goal would be to include an ability to shut off or pull back the model if issues arise to safely and efficiently revert to a safer version of the model.\n",

    "Communication will be conducted and kept over Instagram, expect a response time within 5-6 hours. We will meet once a week, on Mondays at 5:30 PM over Zoom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tone we expect is something that is direct but also courteous and polite. We don’t intend to tiptoe around each other and if we need to recommend solutions or improvements, we must be direct about it while also being empathetic towards the other team members. This would mean emphasizing something along the lines of “Hey, I thought X could be a fantastic idea to incorporate, and wanted to know what your thoughts were on it. Currently, as we are doing Y, I see there are some ways that Z could be improved, and I would love to chat about it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Most things have been a majority vote so far, mainly because we have the luxury of time in most scenarios. However, when starting the actual project work, we will likely assign SME’s or Subject Matter Experts to different aspects of the project to lead it. Some of these can include Filtering SME, Writing SME, Data Analysis SME, etc so certain team members have greater authority or responsibility in different parts of the project. If a decision has to be made in a short time frame and a relevant teammate is non-responsive, so far we have had individual team members to take initiative and do what it takes for the group to succeed. If it is an ill outcome that happens when the corresponding team mate tries to implement a solution when relevant contacts aren’t answering - the whole group will accept the outcome that happens as we are all trying our best for the sake of the project.\n",

    "This is described in more detail in the preceding numbered section, there will likely be more specialization. So far, Afraz Hameed specializes in logistics, meetings, and coordination of work. Other roles will likely come up later, but generally our ideal scenario is everybody working on a little bit of everything, while some specialize further in certain categories. Tasks have currently been assigned to people via Google Docs and for the foreseeable future we intend to use Google Docs with checkboxes and assigning members to tasks using the Comment feature in Google Docs. \n",
    "\n",
    "If someone is struggling to deliver something they promised to do, they must reach out to the group to get further resources, information, or help in achieving their goal. By default, when any of us are assigned to our tasks, the expectation is that they will complete it with what they have. However, if there is any support needed, whether it’s via more teammates helping out, information that could benefit them, or anything else - it is in our team’s responsibility to support them. Preferably, if you’re struggling on a task well over a few hours with no progress whatsoever, it doesn’t hurt to contact the team and inform us of what’s going on. The group will allocate the team members that have the most bandwidth at the time to provide support when needed.\n",
